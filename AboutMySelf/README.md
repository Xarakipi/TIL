# All about me
My name is Artur. 
I am Head of IT Department.

I love new IT devices and software. I constantly update both of them, if something better comes out.
I like to walk and ride a road bike, always accompanied by music.
Recently I started a new hobby - a freshwater aquarium.

1. I am always interested in learning something new.
2. I've heard a lot about DevOps, but I still don't know what it is.
3. I got bored at my current work.

1. Am I interested enough in devops to go into this field.
2. Understanding the basics of devops and finding ways to apply my knowledge in the field of data center construction and IT architecture.
3. To study methods of building relationships and work by devops methods, to find ways to apply in my field of work.
4. Learn more about Andersen and meet new people.
